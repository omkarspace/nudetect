# nudetech (Adult Content Detector)

A web-based application that detects adult content in videos using AI and machine learning. The system can process both direct video uploads and YouTube URLs.

## Features

- Video content analysis through deep learning
- Support for direct video file uploads
- YouTube URL processing and analysis
- Real-time detection and feedback
- User-friendly dark-themed interface
- Mobile-responsive design

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**
  - HTML5
  - CSS3
  - Bootstrap 5
  - JavaScript

- **Backend:**
  - Python
  - TensorFlow/Keras
  - PIL (Python Imaging Library)
  - TensorFlow Hub

## Model Architecture

The system uses a CNN architecture with the following layers:
- Convolutional Layer (32 filters, 3x3 kernel)
- MaxPooling Layer (2x2)
- Flatten Layer
- Dense Layer (128 neurons)
- Output Layer (2 neurons with softmax activation)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage

1. Access the web interface through your browser
2. Choose one of two options:
   - Upload a video file directly
   - Enter a YouTube URL
3. Click "Start Detection" to begin the analysis
4. View the detection results
